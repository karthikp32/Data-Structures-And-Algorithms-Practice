There are certain algorithmic approaches that can be used to get your solution down to a certain time complexity class

Time Complexity Class   Algorithmic Approaches
O(n^2)                  Nested for loops
O(n)                    Linear search, iteration, recursion
O(logn)                 Binary search on sorted array, divide and conquer approach where you are halving the process
O(1)                    Not using loops, some mathematical formula, using bitwise operations
